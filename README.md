# FlashTimingScoreboardServer
FlashTimingScoreboard is a piece of software that can be used to display runners' times at track meets that utilize FlashTiming software. It was developed in Spring of 2021 after a high school track coach approached me about their need for a scoreboard. I wrote this software for them free of charge and decided to open source it.

## Usage
Java is required to use this project. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (click on the JDK download button to get the latest version).

To use FlashTimingScoreboard, download a copy of the server files from the [Releases](https://github.com/jamesjulich/FlashTimingScoreboardServer/releases) page. Then, go to https://github.com/Mr-Zeller/FlashTimingScoreboard and download the web component of the scoreboard.

The .jar file acts as the controller for the web portion. Once both are downloaded, open the .jar file, and then open the web page (titled scoreboard.html, it may also display as just scoreboard on your computer) with a web browser.

For complete instructions, see the "Scoreboard Instructions.pdf" file included with your copy of this software.
